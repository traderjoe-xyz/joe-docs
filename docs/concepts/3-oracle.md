# Oracle

## Introduction

`LBPair` stores cumulative values as a **sample** for the following data:

- Active bin ID
- Volatility accumulated ($v_a$)
- Number of bins crossed ($k$)

The active bin ID can be easily converted into the bin price via helper functions, allowing users to obtain historical prices easily.

Using cumulative values allow us to take the **time-weighted average values** easily.

## Samples

Samples are stored in a 16-bit circular array. Howwever, by default, the oracle array only stores 2 samples, but it can be extended by anyone by calling `increaseOracleLength`. This is to shift the burden of gas cost to the oracle user.

Each sample consists of three values: cumulative bin ID, cumulative volatility accumulated and cumultive bins crossed.

Samples are updated at the end of each swap.

A new sample is created if enough time has passed since the creation of the previous sample as defined by the variable `oracleSampleLifeTime`. To be specific, given a new swap, if the time since creation of sample $i$ has exceeded `oracleSampleLifeTime`, then we create sample $i+1$. Otherwise, we update the cumulative values in sample $i$.

## Time-Weighted Average Values

Sample values can be read by calling `getOracleSampleFrom`. This will return the three cumulative values at the time specified by the `timeDelta` input: `cumulativeId`, `cumulativeVolatilityAccumulated` and `cumulativeBinCrossed`.

To calculate the average value of any of those three variables, `getOracleSampleFrom` needs to called on two different timestamps, and the average value will be:

$$
\textbf{Time Weighted Average}  = \frac{getOracleSampleFrom(t_2).value - getOracleSampleFrom(t_1).value}{timestamp(t_2) - timestamp(t_1)}
$$

To convert time-weighted average ID to time-weighted average price, you can use the `getPriceFromId()` function from the `LBRouter` contract.
