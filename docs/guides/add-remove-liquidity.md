# Add/Remove Liquidity

## Introduction

Liquidity management is performed through `LBRouter` contract. This contract will abstract some of the complexity of the liquidity management, perform safety checks and will revert if certain conditions were to not be met. 
- Liquidity is added or removed to `LBPairs`.
- Liquidity may be distributed to specific `Bins`, with different amounts per `Bin`. 

:::note
- The v2.1 `LBRouter` is not backwards compatible with v2.0 `LBPairs`. 
- The v2.0 `LBRouter` must be used to remove liquidity from v2.0 `LBPairs`.

## Adding Liquidity

To add liquidity, the `LiquidityParameters` struct is as input:

```js
function addLiquidity(LiquidityParameters memory liquidityParameters)
    external
    returns (
        uint256 amountXAdded,
        uint256 amountYAdded,
        uint256 amountXLeft,
        uint256 amountYLeft,
        uint256[] memory depositIds,
        uint256[] memory liquidityMinted
    );

function addLiquidityNATIVE(LiquidityParameters memory liquidityParameters)
    external
    payable
    returns (
        uint256 amountXAdded,
        uint256 amountYAdded,
        uint256 amountXLeft,
        uint256 amountYLeft,
        uint256[] memory depositIds,
        uint256[] memory liquidityMinted
    );
```

### Liquidity Parameters

```js
struct LiquidityParameters {
    IERC20 tokenX; // Has to be the same as tokenX defined in LBPair contract
    IERC20 tokenY; // Has to be the same as tokenY defined in LBPair contract
    uint256 binStep; // Has to point to existing pair
    uint256 amountX; // Amount of token X that you want to add to liquidity
    uint256 amountY; // Amount of token Y that you want to add to liquidity
    uint256 amountXMin; // Defines amount slippage for token X
    uint256 amountYMin; // Defines amount slippage for token Y
    uint256 activeIdDesired; // The active bin you want. It may change due to slippage
    uint256 idSlippage; // The slippage tolerance in case active bin moves during time it takes to transact
    int256[] deltaIds; // The bins you want to add liquidity to. Each value is relative to the active bin ID
    uint256[] distributionX; // The percentage of X you want to add to each bin in deltaIds
    uint256[] distributionY; // The percentage of Y you want to add to each bin in deltaIds
    address to; // Receiver address
    address refundTo; // Refund Address
    uint256 deadline; // Block timestamp cannot be lower than deadline
}
```

The number of parameters are quite extensive. Here are a few pointers to understand how to construct them better:

- The active bin ID may change from the time you decided to add liquidity to when it is actually added. Therefore, you define `activeIdDesired` and `idSlippage` to account for when the price moves.
- `deltaIds` define which bins liquidity will be added to relative to `activeId`, 0 being the active bin. All positive values are bins with only X and all negative values are bins with only Y.
- `distributionX` (or `distributionY`) is the percentages of `amountX` (or `amountY`) you want to add to each bin.
  - Sum of all values should be less than or equal to 1. If less than, the remaining is refunded back to the user.
  - Trying to add X to a bin below the active bin or Y to a bin above the active bin will cause a revert.
- Maximum number of bins, that can be populated at the same time is around `80` on Avalanche C-chain due to block gas limit (`8M`). Multiple transactions can be used to add liquidity to more bins.

### Code Example

In this example, we add 100 USDC and 100 USDT into three bins: active bin, bin below and bin above.

We define the distributions as follow:

- For asset X (USDC), we add 50 USDC to the active bin and 50 USDC to the bin above.
- For asset Y (USDT), we add 33.3 USDT to the active bin and 66.6 USDT to the bin below.

We also allow a bin ID slippage of 5 just in case bin moves in the time it takes to execute the transaction.

```js
uint256 PRECISION = 1e18;
uint256 binStep = 25;
uint256 amountX = 100 * 10e6;
uint256 amountY = 100 * 10e6;
uint256 amountXmin = 99 * 10e6; // We allow 1% amount slippage
uint256 amountYmin = 99 * 10e6; // We allow 1% amount slippage

uint256 activeIdDesired = 2**23; // We get the ID from price using getIdFromPrice()
uint256 idSlippage = 5;

uint256 binsAmount = 3;
int256[] memory deltaIds = new int256[](binsAmount);
deltaIds[0] = -1;
deltaIds[1] = 0;
deltaIds[2] = 1;
uint256[] memory distributionX = new uint256[](binsAmount);
distributionX[0] = 0;
distributionX[1] = PRECISION / 2;
distributionX[2] = PRECISION / 2;

uint256[] memory distributionY = new uint256[](binsAmount);
distributionY[0] = (2 * PRECISION) / 3;
distributionY[1] = PRECISION / 3;
distributionY[2] = 0;


ILBRouter.LiquidityParameters memory liquidityParameters = ILBRouter.LiquidityParameters(
    USDC,
    USDT,
    binStep,
    amountX,
    amountY,
    amountXmin,
    amountYmin,
    activeIdDesired,
    idSlippage,
    deltaIds,
    distributionX,
    distributionY,
    receiverAddress,
    refundAddress,
    block.timestamp
);

USDC.approve(address(router), amountX);
USDT.approve(address(router), amountY);

(
    uint256 amountXAdded,
    uint256 amountYAdded,
    uint256 amountXLeft,
    uint256 amountYLeft,
    uint256[] memory depositIds,
    uint256[] memory liquidityMinted
) = router.addLiquidity(liquidityParameters);
```

## Removing Liquidity

There are some key differences between adding and removing liquidity:

1. We don't use the `LiquidityParameters` struct.
2. We use absolute bin IDs instead of relative bin IDs.
3. Because we use absolute bin IDs, bin slippage is not possible.
4. We define absolute `LBToken` balances to remove from each bin.
   - In bins below active bin, balances consist of only Y.
   - In bins above active bin, balances consist of only X.
   - In the active bin, the balance consists of a share of X and Y.

To remove liquidity, we use one of the router functions below:

```js
function removeLiquidity(
    IERC20 tokenX,
    IERC20 tokenY,
    uint16 binStep, // Has to point to existing pair that user has liquidity deposited in
    uint256 amountXMin, // Minimum amount of token X that has to be withdrawn
    uint256 amountYMin, // Minimum amount of token Y that has to be withdrawn
    uint256[] memory ids, // Bin IDs that liquidity should be removed from
    uint256[] memory amounts, // LBToken amount that should be removed
    address to, // Receiver address
    uint256 deadline // Block timestamp cannot be lower than deadline
) external returns (uint256 amountX, uint256 amountY);

function removeLiquidityNATIVE(
    IERC20 token,
    uint16 binStep,
    uint256 amountTokenMin,
    uint256 amountNATIVEMin,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    address payable to,
    uint256 deadline
) external returns (uint256 amountToken, uint256 amountNATIVE);
```

Here are some pointer for using these functions:

1. Lengths of `ids` and `amounts` must be the same.
2. Values in `amounts` are `LBToken` amounts.
3. Maximum number of bins that can be withdrawn at the same time is around `51` due to Avalanche C-chain block gas limit (`8M`). In this case, multiple transactions can be used to remove more liquidity.

### Code Example

```js
uint256 numberOfBinsToWithdraw = 3;
uint16 binStep = 25;

uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](numberOfBinsToWithdraw);
uint256[] memory ids = new uint256[](numberOfBinsToWithdraw);
ids[0] = 8388608;
ids[1] = 8388611;
ids[2] = 8388605;
uint256 totalXBalanceWithdrawn;
uint256 totalYBalanceWithdrawn;

// To figure out amountXMin and amountYMin, we calculate how much X and Y underlying we have as liquidity
for (uint256 i; i < numberOfBinsToWithdraw; i++) {
    uint256 LBTokenAmount = pair.balanceOf(receiverAddress, ids[i]);
    amounts[i] = LBTokenAmount;
    (uint256 binReserveX, uint256 binReserveY) = pair.getBin(uint24(ids[i]));

    totalXBalanceWithdrawn += LBTokenAmount * binReserveX / pair.totalSupply(ids[i]);
    totalYBalanceWithdrawn += LBTokenAmount * binReserveY / pair.totalSupply(ids[i]);
}

uint256 amountXMin = totalXBalanceWithdrawn * 99 / 100; // Allow 1% slippage
uint256 amountYMin = totalYBalanceWithdrawn * 99 / 100; // Allow 1% slippage

pair.approveForAll(address(router), true);

router.removeLiquidity(
    USDC,
    WAVAX,
    binStep,
    amountXMin,
    amountYMin,
    ids,
    amounts,
    receiverAddress,
    block.timestamp
);
```
