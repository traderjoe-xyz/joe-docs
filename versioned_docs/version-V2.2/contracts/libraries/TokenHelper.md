# TokenHelper
[Git Source](https://github.com/lfj-gg/joe-v2/blob/16f011d25e6bf6d0a0c479974345b623d491104f/src/libraries/TokenHelper.sol)

Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be
successful.
To use this library you can add a `using TokenHelper for IERC20;` statement to your contract,
which allows you to call the safe operation as `token.safeTransfer(...)`


## Functions
### safeTransferFrom

Transfers token and reverts if the transfer fails


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(IERC20 token, address owner, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal;
```

|`token`|`IERC20`|The address of the token|
|`owner`|`address`|The owner of the tokens|
|`recipient`|`address`|The address of the recipient|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount to send|


### safeTransfer

Transfers token and reverts if the transfer fails


```solidity
function safeTransfer(IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal;
